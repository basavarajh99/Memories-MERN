    createStore(): Creates a Redux store that holds the complete state tree of your app. 
    There should only be a single store in your app.

    applyMiddleware(thunk):
        applyMiddleware: A Redux utility function that allows you to enhance the store by applying middleware.
        
        thunk: Middleware (from the redux-thunk package) that lets you write action creators that return 
        function instead of plain action objects. This is useful for handling asynchronous actions like API calls.
    
    compose(...): A utility function from Redux that allows you to compose multiple store enhancers into one. 
    In this case, it is used to apply middleware (like thunk) and potentially other enhancers.

    The <Provider> component makes the Redux store available to any nested components that need to access the

    will render a <Provider> at the top level, with the entire appâ€™s component tree inside of it.

    Store: The current Redux application state lives in an object called the store .
    The store is created by passing in a reducer, and has a method called getState() that returns the 
    current state value
